<h3>Hackfests</h3>
<br/>
<h4>What is a Hackfest?</h4>
<p>Hackfests are when BostonRB members get together twice a month to work on Ruby projects. Most members work on personal projects during this time but everybody is free to work on anything they like.</p>
<br/>
<h4>What should I bring with me?</h4>
<p>Just a laptop and some code to hack on.</p>
<h4>I don't have a laptop or anything to work on, can I still come?</h4>
<p>Yes! There are always people looking to pair up on code.</p>
<br/>

<p>Hackfests take place on the first and third Tuesday of every month from 7pm to 9pm. Please see the <%= link_to 'calendar', page_path('calendar') %> for details on the venues.<p>
